The generated code is quite unreadable even without being compressed, as I was told by the reviewers. So the source code needs to be reviewed each time, making the progress even longer.\n\nAs a result, *I decide not to publish new releases on AMO*, and *keep them on GitHub under releases tab*.\n</blockquote></details>\n-->\n<h3>Why does Violentmonkey requires <code class=\"language-text\">clipboard</code> permission?</h3>\n<p>To make <code class=\"language-text\">GM_setClipboard</code> work on different browsers.</p>\n<p>{% more %}\nFirst of all, the required permission is named <code class=\"language-text\">clipboardWrite</code>, which means it just allows writing to clipboard, but not reading from clipboard.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is a function used in userscripts named <code class=\"language-text\">GM_setClipboard</code>. It writes to clipboard, just exactly what <code class=\"language-text\">clipboardWrite</code> allows.</p>\n<p>On Chrome, the extension can write to clipboard in the background even without <code class=\"language-text\">clipboardWrite</code> permission. But on Firefox, this won't work without the permission. So <code class=\"language-text\">clipboardWrite</code> permission is required to make the extension work on different browsers.\n{% endmore %}</p>\n<h3>Why are third-party sync services used instead of native ones?</h3>\n<p>Because <code class=\"language-text\">browser.storage.sync</code> is designed to sync preferences instead of large data, and it cannot sync data between different browsers. In some browsers there is no such API implemented.</p>\n<p>{% more %}\nAccording to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync\">the document</a>, <code class=\"language-text\">browser.storage.sync</code> is designed to store preferences and sync them to different instances of the same browser with the same user logged in. And something more, up to 100KB of data can be stored and synced.</p>\n<p>So the limitations are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Up to 100KB of data can be stored, even smaller than size of a feature-rich script.</li>\n<li>Only sync on the same browser, no share between Chrome and Firefox.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With third-party sync services (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>More data can be stored.</li>\n<li>Scripts can be shared in Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, Maxthon, etc. Your scripts are synced to different browsers if only Violentmonkey is installed.\n{% endmore %}</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ","date":"2017-09-22T14:41:11.000Z","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/faq"}}
