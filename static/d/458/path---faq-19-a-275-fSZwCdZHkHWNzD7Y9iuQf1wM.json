The generated code is quite unreadable even without being compressed, as I was told by the reviewers. So the source code needs to be reviewed each time, making the progress even longer.\n\nAs a result, *I decide not to publish new releases on AMO*, and *keep them on GitHub under releases tab*.\n</blockquote></details>\n-->\n<h3 id=\"why-does-violentmonkey-requires-clipboard-permission\"><a href=\"#why-does-violentmonkey-requires-clipboard-permission\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why does Violentmonkey requires <code class=\"language-text\">clipboard</code> permission?</h3>\n<p>To make <code class=\"language-text\">GM_setClipboard</code> work on different browsers.</p>\n<p>{% more %}\nFirst of all, the required permission is named <code class=\"language-text\">clipboardWrite</code>, which means it just allows writing to clipboard, but not reading from clipboard.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is a function used in userscripts named <code class=\"language-text\">GM_setClipboard</code>.
